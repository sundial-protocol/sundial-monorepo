# Midgard Node

Server application with GET and POST endpoints for interacting with Midgard.

## How to Run

### With Docker

Using Docker, you can run Midgard node on `localhost:3000` (or another port)
quite easily.

0. If you don't have Docker yet or want to update, follow this [GUIDE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). After installation, do not forget to execute also the [POST-INSTALLATION STEPS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) to avoid using sudo with Docker.

1. Run Docker daemon if it's not running already:

   ```sh
   sudo dockerd
   ```

2. Pack the `midgard-sdk` tarball (see [here](../midgard-sdk/README.md)).

3. Prepare your `.env` file. You can use `.env.example` as your starting point:

   ```sh
   cd ../midgard-node
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   1. When running with `L1_PROVIDER=Kupmios`, you do not need to fill out
      `L1_BLOCKFROST_API_URL` and `L1_BLOCKFROST_KEY`. The remaining fields need
      to be filled out.

4. Install all the dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   ```

   1. If the install fails with an incorrect SHA, that most likely means
      `midgard-sdk` was updated recently, but `pnpm-lock.yaml` still expects the
      old hash. Update the SHA value inside the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file with the
      new one.
   2. Rerun `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Now it should install correctly.

5. Build the midgard-node:

   ```sh
   pnpm build
   ```

6. Run the application stack:

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d

   # or this for development:
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
   ```

Midgard node should be running on port `PORT` (from your `.env`).

You can view logs of `midgard-node` with `docker`:

```sh
# Change container's name as needed:
docker logs -f midgard-node-midgard-node-1
```

If you made any changes to `midgard-node` and had an image running, restart it
with the 3 steps:

```sh
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Without Docker (No Monitoring)

For running the node itself, a running PostgreSQL server is also needed. The
fields you most likely want to modify in your `.env` file are:

```sh
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=midgard
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
LEDGER_MPT_DB_PATH=midgard-ledger-mpt-db
MEMPOOL_MPT_DB_PATH=midgard-mempool-mpt-db
```

With a properly setup database, the following set of commands should start the
most up to date `midgard-node`:

```sh
# Optional
nix develop

# Bundle the SDK
cd ../midgard-sdk
pnpm install
pnpm repack

# Go back to `midgard-node` and force reinstallation of the SDK (faster than
# `pnpm install --force`)
cd ../midgard-node
rm -rf node_module
pnpm install
pnpm listen
```

## Testing

### With Docker

```sh
docker compose run --rm midgard-node-tests
```

### Without Docker

```sh
cd midgard-node
pnpm test
```
