\chapter{Midgard L1 transactions}
\label{h:midgard-l1-transactions}

This chapter specifies the L1 transactions that interact with Midgard's consensus protocol smart contracts.
Whereas the onchain smart contract are specified in a modular way, where each validator is only concerned with its own validity conditions, the transactions specified in this chapter often interact with several of the onchain validators and must satisfy all of their conditions.
In this way, the offchain code can be seen as the integration layer for the onchain code.
