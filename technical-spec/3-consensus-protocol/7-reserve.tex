\section{Reserve}
\label{h:reserve}

When Midgard confirms deposit events, their funds are either transferred into Midgard's reserve or used directly to pay out confirmed withdrawals.
Even when deposits are directly used to pay out withdrawals, any leftover funds from the deposits are transferred into Midgard's reserve.

Midgard's reserve smart contract is responsible for safeguarding these funds, ensuring that they can only be used to pay out confirmed withdrawals.
It also allows the current operator to rearrange the funds within the Reserve spending validator into utxos that are more optimized to process withdrawals of varying sizes with minimal contention.
